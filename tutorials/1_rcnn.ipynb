    "R-CNN stands for **Region-based Convolutional Neural Network**, and was designed speciffically for object detection. Given an input image, R-CNN begins by applying a mechanism called Selective Search to extract **regions of interest (ROI)**, where each ROI is a rectangle that may represent the boundary of an object in image. Depending on the scenario, there may be as many as two thousand ROIs. After that, each ROI is fed through a neural network to produce output features. For each ROI's output features, a collection of support-vector machine classifiers is used to determine what type of object (if any) is contained within the ROI"
